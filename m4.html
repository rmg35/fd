<ul>
<li>avg temp 59-75F</li>
<li>38-64 in of rain before coffee harvest</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>two types of coffee tree
<ul>
<li>arabica and robusta</li>
<li>arabica produces better beans, used by 75% of coffee</li>
<li>robusta is more robust, but also harsher and more caffinated</li>
<li>coffee trees produce fruit 3 - 4 years after planting</li>
<li>arabica trees self-pollinate, robusta needs cross-pollination</li>
<li>15 weeks for green coffee &quot;cherries&quot; to develop</li>
<li>30-35 weeks before they're ripe for picking</li>
<li>2000 coffee cherries / tree / year. 4000 total seeds
<ul>
<li>roughly a pound of roasted coffee</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>large coffee plantations are fucking up the rain forests
<ul>
<li>2.5 acres of coffee trees produces 86lbs of oxygen / day
<ul>
<li>double standard trees</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&quot;shade grown&quot; coffee is coffee in its natural habitat
<ul>
<li>bird friendly!</li>
<li>less need for nitrogen-based fertilizers! (natural forest decay)</li>
<li>coffee tastes better (slower grwoth == better production of flavor)</li>
<li>more expensive, but better for the environment</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>coffee production is labor intensive
<ul>
<li>livelihood for millions, but they don't make much</li>
<li>child labor / lack of education to keep up with quotas</li>
<li>cherries don't ripen at the same time, so you'll be picking from the same
tree over and over</li>
<li>mechanical harvesting is an option, but unripe coffee cherries are
collected and therefore wasted</li>
<li>100kg of cherries -&gt; 12-20 kg of beans</li>
<li>stripping / mechanically harvested coffee needs to be sorted</li>
<li>manual sorting is slow, so water is used
<ul>
<li>good cherries sink</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>pulp is removed from seeds
<ul>
<li>you can push them through a screen if you want</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>then mucilage (remaining pit) has to be removed
<ul>
<li>microorganisms go to town on this shit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>now the beans are ~60% moisture, we need 11-15%
<ul>
<li>drying patios: literally leave them on a slab in the sun</li>
<li>drying tables: basically hammocks of mesh that get spun</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>last moisture is removed by oven
<ul>
<li>ovens are like clothes dryers, tumble drying the beans</li>
<li>stage 1: slow dry</li>
<li>stage 2: 400F, beans swell to twice their size, first crack</li>
<li>stage 3, 428F, beans are now a medium brown</li>
<li>stage 4: 437ishF, final pop, oily sheen
<ul>
<li>amt of time here determines light / med / dark roast</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>roast the fuck out of coffee to mask imperfections</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>caffine
<ul>
<li>darker roast only means more caffine if you measure by volume</li>
<li>by weight, caffine is the same around the board</li>
<li>starbucks sizes: short, tall, grande, venti</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>weasel poop
<ul>
<li>Palm Civet / Luwak</li>
<li>native to tropial jungles (asia / africa)</li>
<li>kopi == indonesian word for coffee</li>
<li>luwak: small, ferret like animal</li>
<li>eats coffee cherries</li>
<li>removes the pulp, but doesn't digest the beans</li>
<li>luwak shit collected, washed, dried, and beans are roasted</li>
<li>Kopi Luwak is expensive
<ul>
<li>black ivory is more expensive, it's the same idea but with elephants
instead of weasels</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>said to not be bitter and be aromatic</li>
</ul>

<li>now we have drip coffee makers</li>
<li>1908, first drip coffee maker by german housewife Melitta Bentz</li>
<li>wanted to keep coffee grounds out, a filter did the trick</li>
