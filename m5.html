<p>history</p>
<ul>
<li>mesopotamians dometicated cattle</li>
<li>Genghis Khan
<ul>
<li>wanted to rule the world</li>
<li>Mongol horsemen rode on conquests</li>
<li>they moved too quick to cook food</li>
<li>put raw meat under their saddle</li>
<li>this basically pounded the meat flat, which they then snacked on</li>
<li>at night they mixed with eggs and milk, raw</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mongols invaded Russia under Kublai Khan
<ul>
<li>russians took note of this flattening meat technique</li>
<li>called it &quot;Steak Tartare&quot;, after their name for the Mongols: Tatars /
Tartars</li>
<li>it's popular in FR</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>German ships began sailing from Hamburg, ending up in Russia
<ul>
<li>DE was interested, brought it back home</li>
<li>they molded the chopped meat into a steak shape, salted it, and smoked /
cooked it</li>
<li>&quot;Hamburg Steak&quot;</li>
<li>often minced before eating</li>
<li>19th century: German immigrants brought Hamburg Steak to NY</li>
<li>shredded meat, salt, spices to prepare the steak</li>
<li>eaten raw or cooked</li>
<li>immigrants would often make their money opening eateries</li>
<li>still no bun: so not a burger, yet</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ground Beef
<ul>
<li>1829: E. Wade patented the &quot;meat cutter&quot;</li>
<li>G.A. Coffman improved it, patented &quot;machine for cutting meat&quot;</li>
<li>the same concept, just improved, is how we make ground beef today</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bun
<ul>
<li>hotly debated</li>
<li>late in the 1800s</li>
<li>origin claimed by Connecticut, Ohio, New York, Texas</li>
<li>Wisconsin
<ul>
<li>&quot;Home of the Hamburger&quot;</li>
<li>Charlie Nagreen, 15 y/o, meatball business at Outgamie County Fair in
Seymour</li>
<li>cooked meatballs and served them from his cart</li>
<li>didn't sell: meatballs were hard to handle while walking</li>
<li>solution: flatten them and put them in slices of bread</li>
<li>this worked, and became his business model until his death in '51</li>

<li>New York
<ul>
<li>1885</li>
<li>brothers Frank and Charles Menches traveled following the fair circuits
selling sausage sandwhiches</li>
<li>bros ran out of pork suasages in the summer</li>
<li>pigs were only slaughtered in winter</li>
<li>ground beef patties for their sandwiches instead</li>
<li>instant hit</li>
<li>named Hamburger for their origin: Hamburg, NY</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Otto Kuase / Krause: German cook, (supposedly) invented the hamburger in
Hamburg, DE
<ul>
<li>fried Hamburg Steak in button, between two slices of bread, and topped
with an egg</li>
<li>US Library of Congress calls BS, and gives the nod to Louis Lassen</li>
<li>White Castle, first fast food restaurant, says the German guy is the
real deal</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Louis Lassen / Connecticut
<ul>
<li>danish immigrant to New Haven, CT</li>

<li>Fletcher Davis / Athens, Texas
<ul>
<li>lunch counter</li>
<li>grilled ground beef patties between slices of home-made toast with
mustard and onion</li>
<li>him and his wife opened a stand selling the burgers at the 1904 World's
Fair in St. Louis, MO</li>
<li>likely where 10s of thousands would experience burgers for the first
time</li>
<li>friend of Davis suggested the addition of fried potato strips, or
French Fries, along side the burgers</li>
<li>we didn't invent fries, the Belgians (probably) did
<ul>
<li>1600s, poor villagers ate fried fish that they caught</li>
<li>during the winter, the river froze over, so they sliced potatoes and
fried them the same way</li>
<li>WWI, american soldiers introduced to it</li>
<li>named French Fries, because the Belgians spoke French</li>
<li>that name is mostly American, the rest of the world calls it Chips</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>not an immediate success</p>

<li>Embalmed Beef Scandal:
<ul>
<li>Spanish-American War, 1898</li>
<li>US poorly equipped to feed its soldiers</li>
<li>Secretary of War, Russel Alger, commissioned Chicago's big 3 to provide
meat for the army at the lowest possible cost</li>
<li>army urged him to use local cattle in Cuba, but he wanted to support the
new and upcoming industry</li>
<li>meat packers took advantage and took major shortcuts, using bad meat with
untested preservatives</li>
<li>hundreds of tons of rotten meat arrived in cuba</li>
<li>2x soldiers died from food poisoning than combat</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1906: Upton Sinclair

for ladling the sausage</li>
<li>all sorts of shit made it to market</li>
<li>some jobs rarely got done, like cleaning the waste barrels</li>
<li>much of the waste was sold to production</li>
<li>T. Roosevelt was pissed, and demanded congress take action</li>

</li>

burgers</li>
<li>opened a burger shop in Wichita with the kitchen in plain view</li>
<li>employees wore clean uniforms</li>
<li>called the restaurant White Castle</li>
<li>burgers were actually meatballs, which later got flattened and put between
dinner rolls</li>
<li>tiny burgers were a huge success, especially among factory workers</li>
<li>he tried opening a second location in a dentist, but they wanted to turn
him down, because ew immigrants gross</li>
<li>real estate agent, Billy Ingram, decided to partner with Anderson</li>
<li>Ingram began acquiring places for expansion</li>
<li>spread across the mid-west</li>
<li>Ingram assumed control of the business, to Anderson's dismay</li>
<li>he demanded perfection from his employees, so much so that he closed all
locations for two weeks to intensely train everyone on making consistent
burgers</li>
<li>WC expanded throughout the Great Depression, and even began the practice of
putting coupons in the paper</li>
<li>Anderson had enough though, and flipped his share to Ingram in 1933</li>

<li>Krystal Kreed: clean establishment, best food, properly cooked, quick,
efficient, and courteous service, at the lowest price</li>
<li>no takeout, inexpensive dishes</li>
<li>originally no franchises, but Davenport caved</li>
<li>several employees filed a class action lawsuit over altered time cards</li>
<li>this led to Krystal filing for bankruptcy, which in turn led to them being
sold to Port Royal Holdings</li>

with a gas flame at the end</li>
<li>lagging behind McD's, so they experimented with larger patties</li>
