<li>salt for preventing disease:
<ul>
<li><strong>goiter</strong>: swelling of the thyroid gland (in throat)</li>
<li>caused by iodine deficiency</li>
<li>iodine comes from seafood and dairy</li>
<li>needed in the synthesis of thyroid horomones</li>
<li>pituitary gland releases thyroid stimulating horomone, too much and

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>HFCS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>corn starch + a-amylase = long chains of glucose (<strong>oligosaccharides.</strong>)</li>

monosaccharides</li>
<li>glucose treated with glucose isomerase -&gt; 42% fructose, 50% glucose</li>
<li>mixtures goes through a process of separation and enrichment -&gt; 90%
fructose</li>
<li>blended into high froctose corn syrup</li>
<li>HFCS discovered in '57, didn't take off until trade restrictions led to
a sugar shortage</li>
<li>plenty of corn, so we used it on HFCS</li>
<li>1980: coke quietly switched to HFCS</li>

<li><strong>Constantin Fahlberg</strong>, russian chemist who came to work with remsen</li>
<li>fahlberg working with benzoic sulfimide (other coal tar), got some on his

<li>taste tested all of his chemicals -&gt; it was benzoic sulfimide</li>
<li>patented that shit as saccharin</li>
<li>criticized for being hazardous
<ul>
<li><strong>Dr. Harvey Wiley</strong> wanted it banned</li>
<li>President T. Roosevelt wasn't having it tho, so wiley resigned</li>
<li>later called an adulterant, but then sugar ran out in WWI</li>
<li>later later, prohibited from adding anything to food that had any
