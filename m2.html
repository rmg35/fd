<li>
<p>we overcook pork, but not beef!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sus scrofa == scientific name for pig</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pigs were first tamed in 10,000BC</p>
<ul>
<li>domesticated in china ~4900BC</li>
<li>europe ~1500BC</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>big bill (jackson, tn, us) was the largest pig in the world</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pigs aren't native to NA</p>
<ul>
<li>columbus brought them at queen isabella's request</li>
<li>de soto brought pigs before, and released them into the wild</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>iowa has the most pigs in the US</p>
<ul>
<li>minnesota and north carolina trail it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>beef and pork rule in terms of production, but chicken leads in consumption</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>us consumes less pork than other countries, but more beef and poultry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pigs were originally raised for lard</p>
<ul>
<li>fed grain diets to pack on the pounds</li>
<li>pigs raised for bacon are given a more varied diet, and grow more lean</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>before WW2, lard was the shit for frying stuff in</p>
<ul>
<li>WW2 happens, US needs lard for explosives, no more lard for the people</li>
<li>they turn to vegetable oil instead, and never turn back</li>
<li>less call for lard, less call for lard pigs</li>
<li>more call for leaner meat pigs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>leaner cuts of pork actually have less calories than lean cuts of chicken or beef</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pigs are the fourth most intelligent animals</p>
<ul>
<li>they're also relatively competent (and destructive) pets</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>OG pigs were raised on small farms with little management</p>
<ul>
<li>allowed to forage in the fields</li>
<li>fed scraps and old, often rotten, food</li>
<li>pigs don't sweat, and so regulated their body temperature using mud</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>modern pig farms are indoors</p>
<ul>
<li>no mud for pigs, they get A/C instead</li>
<li>floors designed to remove waste</li>
<li>robot wash carts to spray water at waste</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>whole lotta pig slander</p>
<ul>
<li>pouring coke on a slab of pork causes worms to crawl out</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>pigs are used to hunt truffles (fungi)</p>
<ul>
<li>they can sniff them out</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>all raw meat has bacteria on its surface</p>
<ul>
<li>pork tends to carry trichinella spiralis, a worm</li>
<li>that worm causes trichinosis</li>
<li>larvae form cysts in the muscles, someone eats the cysts, they got worms, owned</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>feed a pig infected junk, they'll get the worms</p>
<ul>
<li>eat the uncooked pig, you get them too</li>
<li>these days, we don't let pigs get sick like that</li>
<li>most cases in the US are from undercooked game meats</li>
<li>you can kill the worms with heat, hence why cooking works</li>

<h2>6 - Damned spoiled food</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>food preservation targets slowing the rate at which food spoils</p>
<ul>
<li>spoilage can be caused by:
<ul>
<li>microorganisms (bacteria, mold)</li>
<li>oxidation (rancidity)</li>
<li>insects</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>cooking is a means of preserving food, at least temporarily</li>
<li>one of the earliest methods: drying
<ul>
<li>preserves food by removing moisture, slowing microbial spoilage</li>
<li>1000BC, chinese using salt and smoking to preserve foods</li>
<li>later, fermentation, which also adds new tastes</li>
<li>most significant changes have come via recent discoveries (and wars)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>the ancient chinese discovered fermentation as a means of preservation</p>
<ul>
<li>originally vegetables, meat was added later</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>salting also existed</p>
<ul>
<li>used in ancient egypt to preserve mummies</li>
<li>later realized its use in preserving food</li>
<li>drying and smoking date back to 6000 BC
<ul>
<li>smoking also adds flavor</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>early preservation in egypt targeted grains and cereals</p>
<ul>
<li>primarily employed drying and storage in rudimentary silos</li>
<li>crop production relied on the nile flooding, so these silos provided them backup if it ever didn't</li>
<li>drying provided jobs thought to be distinguished and important</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>fermentation of grains lead to beer</p>
<ul>
<li>produced as far back as 4000BC by the egyptians</li>
<li>early on, not really alcoholic</li>
<li>wine fermentation came later, and was way more complex
<ul>
<li>reserved for the elite</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ancient egyptians also enjoyed drying and salting fish and meat</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>earliest evidence of wine making dates back to 6000BC</p>
<ul>
<li>grape growing spread across egypt</li>
<li>writing was first developed in this region in the late 4th century BC
<ul>
<li>evidence of ration lists, food distribution records, inventories of granaries</li>
<li>ancient preservation methods archived</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>tannur ovens were primitive ovens used for cooking grains and breads in mesopotamia</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>made of clay and gypsum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>capable of withstanding 1500F</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mesopotamians learned to press the dried fish to release oils</p>
<ul>
<li>oils used for cooking, flavoring, and preserving foods</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>early beer was low in alcohol, but provided proteins and nutrients to the egyptian diet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>african mummies have been discovered with high levels of tatracycline, a modern antibiodic</p>
<ul>
<li>it's because of the soil getting into the fermentation process</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>ancient egyptians knew how to use alcohol to treat infections</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in the ruins of pompeii, archelogists have found jars of fruit preserved in honey</p>
<ul>
<li>low moisture content of the honey would've prevented growth of microorganisms / protected from oxidation</li>
<li>rome is the source of the first preserved ham
<ul>
<li>like modern day PROSCIUTTO</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>vikings laid fish on their ships to let the wind and salt water dry them</li>
<li>early native americans made a product called pemmican
<ul>
<li>remove fat from meat</li>
<li>cook meat</li>
<li>fat and meat into a paste</li>
<li>add dried berries and spices</li>
<li>molded into squares with low moisture content</li>
<li>basicall native american energy bars</li>
<li>important to fur traders in 17th - 19th centuries</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>fire was the first revolution of food, preservation was the second</p>
<ul>
<li>Nicolas Appert, french chef, confectioner, distiller</li>
<li>napoleon needed a way to get food to his soldiers</li>
<li>traditional food preservation measures weren't cutting it</li>
<li>prize of 12,000 francs to anyone who can effectively preserve food</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>appert took the challenge and discovered canning</p>
<ul>
<li>canning was popular in WWI &amp; II due to rationing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>appert knew excluding air was critical to preserve food</p>
<ul>
<li>strong corks that supported the inside and outside of wide-mouth bottles and withstood pressure</li>
<li>glue out of isinglass (dried swim bladders of fish) to join pieces of cork to fit the jars</li>
<li>mixed quicklime (cement) and water to seal corks to the tops of bottles</li>
<li>wide mouths of bottles == wide variety of food could fit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>appert cooked various foods and them put them into jars</p>
<ul>
<li>jars went into large pots of water and were boiled</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>appert spent 7 years to perfect his work</p>
<ul>
<li>samples sent to napoleon's army pleased napoleon</li>
<li>appert awarded the 12,000 franc prize</li>
<li>canning sometimes referred to as appertization</li>
<li>institute of food technologists presents a Nicolas Appert award</li>
<li>&quot;Nicolas Appert Year&quot; in france, 2010</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>appert's method spread like wildfire</p>
<ul>
<li>peter durand invented the tin can (actually iron)</li>
<li>john hall and byran dorking (EN) opened the first canning factory in 1813</li>
<li>1846, henry evans (US) invented a better machine for making the cans</li>
<li>1858, john mason invented the &quot;mason&quot; jar, which lead to home canning</li>
<li>frank and edmund ball began producing &quot;ball&quot; jars after mason's patent expired</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>canning was important, as was freezing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1000BC, chinese freezed foods outside of the winter</p>
<ul>
<li>dug a large cellar in the ground and line the walls in ice</li>
<li>greeks and romans had similar tactics, also stored under cool water</li>
<li>extended shelf-life, but didn't provide long-term preservation</li>
<li>ancient incas learned higher altitude == longer lasting food
<ul>
<li>they were basically freeze drying their foods</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>freeze drying food</p>
<ul>
<li>by reducing pressure, water would directly vaporize from foods</li>
<li>developed during WWII to preserve blood plasma and penicillin
<ul>
<li>penicillin was discovered in 1928 by Alexander Fleming</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>henry nestle used freeze drying to preserve coffee</li>
<li>james mercer pioneered freeze drying coffee, somehow</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>clarence birdseye, &quot;father of frozen food&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>he didn't invent freezing food, but he drastically improved it</li>
<li>became an outdoorsman selling trapped animals for fur or research</li>
<li>had to drop out when money was tight, worked for the US Department of Agriculture's Biological Survey</li>
<li>howard t. ricketts discovered the bacteria that causes Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever: Rickettsia</li>
<li>anyway, birdseye quit his job and went hunting for furs on dogsled</li>
<li>dude ate almost anything</li>
<li>married, had a kid, moved to the middle of nowhere</li>
<li>noticed natives freezing food, and how it was fresh once thawed</li>
<li>began experimenting with frozen fish</li>
<li>two major innovations:
<ol>
<li>importance of rapid freezing for best quality</li>
<li>reail consumer packaging</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>no one trusted his food, so he went bankrupt</li>
<li>new company: now we're inventing freezers</li>
<li>went down a belt and got super cold somehow idfc</li>
<li>first commercially practical freezer</li>
<li>sold his shares in the company to Charles Post / Postum Cereal Company</li>
<li>stuck around to do research</li>
<li>still unsuccessful, so birdeye worked on display cases</li>
<li>WWII saw japan taking over where tin gets made, so we needed something new to put shit in</li>
<li>grocers filled empty space with frozen foods</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>expiration dates</p>
<ul>
<li>highest quality until this date</li>
<li>you don't have to throw shit away immediately after the expiration date unless it's something super parishable</li>
<li>rule of thumb: if you don't see anything wrong, and don't smell anything wrong, there's probably nothing wrong</li>
</ul>

<h2>7 - Louis Pasteur got milk</h2>
<ul>
<li>Louis Jean Pasteur
<ul>
<li>
<p>father served under napoleon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>skilled painter, but father pushed him away from it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>admitted to École Normale Supérieure, paris</p>
<ul>
<li>prestigious graduate school</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>studied chemistry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>got his doctorate, began teaching</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>married Marie Laurrent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5 children, 2 made it through childhood</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>moved to University of Lille</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>took an interest to fermentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>comissioned to study wine production, found bacterial contaminants produced lactic aid, which spoiled the wine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if yeast is exposed to air during fermentation, less alcohol is produced</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>returned to EN</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>demonstrated that microorganisms also spoiled other beverages, like beer and milk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>began to speculate that microorganisms causes disease</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>started doing studies to prove it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;theory of spontaneous generation&quot; was widely accepted at this time</p>
<ul>
<li>recipe for creating mice:
<ul>
<li>bedding material (dirty underwear)</li>
<li>grain</li>
<li>profit</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>francesco redi challenged the theory in the mid 1600's</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pasteur continued his experience</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>redi's experiment was simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>three pairs of jars, each with raw meat</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>first pair: jars wide open</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>second pair: jars sealed tightly with lids</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>third pair: covered in cheesecloth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>maggots formed in first jar, but not second or third</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>flies were attracted to the meat, and laid their eggs there</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>pasteur did a similar experiment:</p>
<ul>
<li>added meat broth to a swan-neck flask, and boiled it to kill any microorganisms in it</li>
<li>after sitting for days, nothing happened</li>
<li>boiled another flask of broth, but then broke the neck of the flask</li>
<li>broth showed growth in a couple of days</li>
<li>also tested where only some broth was exposed to microorganisms in the air</li>
<li>boiled the microorganism flask to show heat killed microorganisms</li>
<li>provided evidence for the &quot;germ theory of disease&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>published &quot;Studies on Fermentation&quot;, describing the spoilage of beer and how to prevent it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>patented a process for brewing beer</p>
<ul>
<li>didn't invent it, but substantially improved it</li>
<li>before times:
<ul>
<li>boil infusion of ground malted grains (wort)</li>
<li>let it sit to cool <strong>[!]</strong></li>
<li>add yeast to the mash</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>exposure to open air [!] is no bueno</li>
<li>new method:
<ul>
<li>boil wort</li>
<li>leave it in the enclosed tanks</li>
<li>cool wort by spraying tanks with water</li>
<li>add yeast to enclosed mash</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>still pretty much in used today</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>he and his assistant, claude bernard, began their first heat-killing experiments using beer and wine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>napoleon III asked him to study the souring of beer and wine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>later extended the application of heat to milk, which we still used today as 'pasteurization'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>originally, milk was heated in batches,</p>
<ul>
<li>'vat pasteurization'</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>63C for 30min</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>didn't scale well, so heat exchangers (&quot;pasteurizers&quot;) came to be</p>
<ul>
<li>continuously processed the milk at higher temperatures for shorter times to achieve the same effect</li>
<li>milk could now be filled into bottles without exposing them to air</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>72C for 15sec or 89C - 100C for 1 or 0.01 seconds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>europe: 138C for 2 seconds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;germ theory of disease&quot; set the basis for spoilage of beverages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>belief that germ caused human diseases</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pasteur believed that preventing microorganisms from entering the human body will reduce human illness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pasteur recognized as the &quot;father of bacteriology&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>his research was continued by robert koch in the 1880s</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>joseph lister was a british surgeon during the time of pasteur and koch</p>
<ul>
<li>interested in bacteriology and wound infections</li>
<li>lister introduced carbolic acid as a means to sterilize surgical instruments and treat wounds</li>
<li>lister began using vaporized carbolic acid to &quot;sterilize&quot; the surgical field around a patient</li>
<li>reduced post-operative infections and deaths</li>
<li>lister became the father of &quot;antiseptic surgery&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>listerine was developed by dr joseph lawrence</p>
<ul>
<li>originally used as an surgical antiseptic</li>
<li>named after lister</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>lawrence licensed it to jordan lambert in 1881</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lambert marketed it as an oral antiseptic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pasteur made several vaccines too</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>interest in the work of edward jenner, who discovered a vaccine for smallpox in 1796</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cows were milked by women</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cows got cowpox, which passed on to the women</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>jenner realized the maid's hands got scarred from cowpox, but they never got scarred from smallpox like everyone else</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he injected the pus from their hands into an eight year old boy, and then injected him with smallpox</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the kid lived</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>jenner found the first vaccine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>later they started using &quot;toxoids&quot; (dead viruses) instead</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pasteur began working to develop a vaccine for chicken cholera</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he instructed his assistant to inoculate chickens with the virus while he was on vacation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>his assistant flaked out on him, and only did it last minute</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>these chickens were given old viruses, and therefore weren't affected</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>basically, they got a vaccination for it by accident</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pasteur patented a vaccine for antrax, a deadly disease to sheep and other animals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he treated antrax bacteria with potassium chromate (oxidizing agent)</p>
<ul>
<li>basically killed the bacteria</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>pasteur touted his &quot;cure&quot;, famous veterinarian rossignol challenged him, pasteur proved it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>anthrax was touted as a bio-weapon after 9/11</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he also discovered the vaccine for rabies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>9 y/o joseph meister was bitten by a rabid dog</p>
<ul>
<li>mom pleaded with pasteur to treat him</li>
<li>he caved, gave it to him, he survive</li>
<li>kid became caretaker at the pasteur institute</li>
<li>commited suicide in 1940 instead of opening pasteur's tomb to the nazis</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>old yeller: dog from an old disney movie</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>got rabies after being bit by a wolf attacking his family</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>old yeller died from being shot, not rabies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he wasn't actually harmed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pasteur died in 1895 after several strokes</p>
